Our data is a messy excel document. The column of interest is filled with hyperlinks that lead to an essay. This essay I will eventually parse for our Service Learnign keywords.

The essays need to be extracted from the hyperlinks and put into a new column. The R file attached will grab the essay and parse through it. The count for the words will be returned to the column to the right of the essay.
